<h1 style="font-size: 1.4em; border-bottom: 1px solid #cccccc; margin: 30px 0; padding: 10px;">About AECT Legends and Legacies</h1>
<p>The AECT Legends and Legacies Project is a collaborative endeavor among the Association for Educational Communications and Technology (AECT) members to capture the voices of leaders, past and present, in the field of educational technology (ET). Through this initiative, an online archive of video interviews with prominent ET scholar and practitioners has been created and is now available through the AECT Website.</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 1.2em; border-bottom: 1px solid #cccccc; margin: 30px 0; padding: 10px;">What is Educational Technology?</h2>
<p>The AECT defines educational technology as the study and ethical application of theory, research, and best practices to advance knowledge as well as mediate and improve learning and performance through the strategic design, management and implementation of learning and instructional processes and resources.</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 1.2em; border-bottom: 1px solid #cccccc; margin: 30px 0; padding: 10px;">Conversations with Leaders in Educational Technology</h2>
<figure style="float: right; margin-left: 30px;"><img src="http://res.cloudinary.com/dwuwuaov5/image/upload/v1521833379/aect_about.jpg" style="width: 400px;"><figcaption>Robert Heinich interviewed bt Barbara Lockee for Legends and Legacies Project.</figcaption></figure><p>Various schools in the field of educational technology have documented the early beginnings and evolution in the field of educational technology. Through a recent project of the AECT, the recording of historical documentation is occurring.</p>
<p>These conversations contribute to the documentation of ET's development as a discipline through the individual stories and personal insights from those who have shaped the field through their work.</p>
<h2 style="font-size: 1.2em; border-bottom: 1px solid #cccccc; margin: 30px 0; padding: 10px; clear: both;">The Future of AECT Legends and Legacies</h2>
<p>As the AECT Legends and Legacies Project has developed as a group-based endeavor, plans for its future also depend on the input of the ET community as a whole. Other faculty, students, or ET professionals may conduct interviews and then added to the repository by the administrative manager at Virginia Tech.</p>
<p>Perhaps graduate programs in ET may undertake such interviews as class projects and contribute the outcomes to the online database. With participation from the many international leaders in the field, the desire is that the interviews grow more global in size.</p>
<p>The infrastructure has developed such that "crowdsourcing" the interviews will allow for the capture and inclusion of these important conversations in a more scalable manner than a more limited project team approach.</p>
<p>Another future goal is to digitize existing interviews that were recorded using older media, such as videotape or film. Several universities have indicated the availability of such recordings for inclusion in the Legends and Legacies archive.</p>
<p>Expanding the respository to include interviews available through other media, such as audio recording and printed transcripts is also a possibility.</p>
